## Terraform 101 for data

From Zero.

By [James Woolfenden](https://www.linkedin.com/jameswoolfenden/)

I've been using Terraform since version 0.5 <https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-0-5/> while that seems a while, I'm still learning and it's still changing.
I've used it with all of the main public clouds. The majority of the examples here will target AWS, but no prior knowledge is required.

## Pre-requisites

Terraform 0.12.21 or newer.
An editor, VSCode, Atom or equivalent.

!!! note
These lessons are aimed at anyone, only familiarity with Git and a code editor [atom or VSCode] is expected.

    Terraform can be a real handful to type at the CLI, but at least its not called *constellation* as originally planned.
