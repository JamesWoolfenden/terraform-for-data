Below is the same thing In Terraform, in code, stating how the instance should be: resource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" { instance_type = \"t2.micro\" ami = \"ami-7ad7c21e\" subnet_id = \"subnet-05f8f3c120238ca8d\" vpc_security_group_ids = [ \"sg-05749b21616ab0cdc\" , ] } Now If you modify the instance in any way - in this case by adding tags: aws ec2 create - tags --resources i-0529e7f9f72b02a53 --tags Key=Stack,Value=production You can check for configuration drift by using Terraform plan, (this is not possible with the cli) this command will show the difference between your orignal coded definition and current reality: $ terraform plan Refreshing Terraform state in - memory prior to plan ... The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan , but will not be persisted to local or remote state storage . aws_instance . example : Refreshing state ...

Just the Tags are new. This somehow detected the change in configuration. You can eliminate the \"drift\" by executing Terraform Apply again. Idempotency Configuration managament tools are generally Idempotent. If you execute your AWS command: aws ec2 run - instances --image-id ami-7ad7c21e --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name basic --region eu-west-2 --subnet-id subnet-05f8f3c120238ca8d What would happen? You'd get anopther new instances as the command is not Idempotent. This doesn't happen with each invocation in Terraform, each invocation is matched with is resulting Terrafrom.tfstate or its state file which is used to maintain a record of activity. This \"statefile\" is crucial to your use and understanding of how Terraform works. To remove the instance via the cli id have exectute a whole new cli command but id also have to find the instance_id. With Terraform its just: Terraform destroy And the account will return to state it was before you created the instance, no orphaned objects ever remain. Takeaways The destroy and apply command always give you a chance to review the changes before they happen. Hello World Ensure that you have Terraform and an editor (VScode) installed: At your shell, make a null resource by creating a file called null_resource.helloworld.tf . touch null_resource.helloworld.tf A null resource doesn't do anything by itself and doesn't require any Cloud Provider Authentication. Then add the block below to it. resource \"null_resource\" \"hello_world\" { } You have just created your first Terraform template, but as yet it does nothing. The next step is to add a local executable Provisioner, to give the null resource some utility: resource \"null_resource\" \"hello_world\" { provisioner \"local-exec\" { # This is a comment command = \"echo 'hello world'\" } } Fairly straighforward? Time to try your work with terraform init at your shell. $ terraform init Initializing the backend... Initializing provider plugins... - Checking for available provider plugins... - Downloading plugin for provider \"null\" ( hashicorp/null ) 2 .1.2... The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration, so the latest version was installed. To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking changes, it is recommended to add version = \"...\" constraints to the corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below. * provider.null: version = \"~> 2.1\" Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. Terraform init is only needed on new templates and when you add modules or change module versions or providers. You don't have to remember it all, Terraform will fail at apply. Now that has been set up, you can try terraform apply , and when prompted, say yes. $ terraform apply An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # null_resource.hello_world will be created + resource \"null_resource\" \"hello_world\" { + id = ( known after apply ) } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. Do you want to perform these actions? Terraform will perform the actions described above. Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve. Enter a value: yes null_resource.hello_world: Creating... null_resource.hello_world: Provisioning with 'local-exec' ... null_resource.hello_world ( local-exec ) : Executing: [ \"cmd\" \"/C\" \"echo 'hello world'\" ] null_resource.hello_world ( local-exec ) : 'hello world' null_resource.hello_world: Creation complete after 1s [ id = 5019739039794330655 ] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. You have made a Terraform template that does something! Now check what files you have on your filesystem. ls -al total 1 drwxrwxrwx 1 jim jim 512 Feb 22 06 :59 . drwxrwxrwx 1 jim jim 512 Feb 22 06 :54 .. drwxrwxrwx 1 jim jim 512 Feb 22 06 :56 .terraform -rwxrwxrwx 1 jim jim 139 Feb 22 06 :59 null.helloworld.tf -rwxrwxrwx 1 jim jim 513 Feb 22 06 :59 terraform.tfstate Terraform.tfstate is your local state file .terraform contains your providers and modules[if any]. Refactor We can be and should be more specify, state the exact Provider version required provider.null.tf provider \"null\" { version = \"2.1.2\" } We specify versions so that we reproduce the same result. Specify the TF core version by specifying Terraform version in terraform.tf terraform { required_version = \"0.12.20\" } State files are linked to TF core version, all members of a team using TF need to use the same version. If one upgrades, all must upgrade, so add this to ensure that you mean to. Re-test these changes with a new apply. Real world example resource \"null_resource\" \"waiter\" { depends_on = [ aws_iam_instance_profile . ec 2 profile ] provisioner \"local-exec\" { command = \"sleep 15\" } } This is basically a hack, pretty much any use of a null resources is up to something dubious. In this case AWS was being rubbish and reported that an object was made when it wasn't yet - eventually consistent and so here we are with a sleep statement. I rarely use Provisioners myself these days, they are bad style and a hangover from Terraforms beginnings. Takeaways Naming Versions Provisioners Providers Plan & apply Exercise Change the required_version to \"0.12.25\" and Apply, what happens? Questions When could specifying the Version still be insufficient for repeatability? when the underlying API itself changes and is no longer backwardly compatible, this wont happen very quickly but it will happen. Its also is bound to the version of the Terraform tool you are using.

Then add the block below to it. resource \"null_resource\" \"hello_world\" { } You have just created your first Terraform template, but as yet it does nothing. The next step is to add a local executable Provisioner, to give the null resource some utility: resource \"null_resource\" \"hello_world\" { provisioner \"local-exec\" { # This is a comment command = \"echo 'hello world'\" } } Fairly straighforward? Time to try your work with terraform init at your shell. $ terraform init Initializing the backend... Initializing provider plugins... - Checking for available provider plugins... - Downloading plugin for provider \"null\" ( hashicorp/null ) 2 .1.2... The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration, so the latest version was installed. To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking changes, it is recommended to add version = \"...\" constraints to the corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below. * provider.null: version = \"~> 2.1\" Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. Terraform init is only needed on new templates and when you add modules or change module versions or providers. You don't have to remember it all, Terraform will fail at apply. Now that has been set up, you can try terraform apply , and when prompted, say yes. $ terraform apply An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
