I have a bit of experience in the DevOps field, I have worked for a number of consultancies directly and indirectly. This is the second of series on Learning about DevOps. Why This is small run through of using Hashicorp Terraform. As a consultant I frequently have to train developers and \"DevOps\" Engineers how, why and when to use it. I started using Terraform from around version 0.5, I was on a Greenfield AWS project and was really struggling with Cloudformation and its tooling. I asked a question on Linkedin on what others were using and the steers I got were Terraform or Ansible. I achieved more in the day after than in the previous week. Hopefully you'll find this book useful. If it's missing or wrong in anyway, log an Issue or even submit a PR. Each Chapter also contains a copy of the code the chapter tries to teach you how to create. I originally wrote this for the pre 0.11 Terraform and I hopefully updated everything to 0.12 and all the samples should work.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#author-james-woolfenden","text":"LinkedIn","title":"Author: James Woolfenden"},{"location":"about/#bio","text":"I'm currently working as a Solution Principal for Slalom and based out of London.
